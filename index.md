That’s a sharp distinction. Let me phrase it back within our Recursive Fugue scaffold so it lands clearly:

* **Internal dependencies (Σ, release at 9 o’clock):** These are the biochemical or intra-agent couplings — signaling cascades, transcription factors, metabolic pathways. They *aren’t* the result of intention or negotiation. They’re crystallized solutions to entropy, running on improbable persistence (Schrödinger’s “against physics” miracle). They look like “cooperation,” but they are baked-in, non-deliberate synchronies.

* **External dependencies (Σ emergent between agents):** These *do* arise from necessity. Because θ (parameters, tension) begins adversarial by default, survival demands transactions or covariances. Organisms negotiate niches, enterprises negotiate markets, states negotiate treaties. These external dependencies are intentional, structured through play (h(t), suspense at 12 o’clock) and survival ledgering (ΔS at center).

So:

* Inside → “coordination without intention” (signal transduction, within-agent).
* Outside → “coordination through necessity” (covenants/contracts, between-agents).

Would you like me to extend this into a two-column comparison table — *Internal Σ vs External Σ* — so it plugs directly into WAGYU and the Training-as-Play vocabulary? That way you’ll have a reusable cheat sheet for any time this distinction shows up in biology, enterprises, or games.

| Core idea                     |                             Coordination *without intention* — crystallized couplings that keep an agent together. | Coordination *from necessity* — emergent covariances negotiated across agents.                              |

| Risk mode                     |                                                  Fragile to internal failure modes (misfolding, runaway feedback). | Fragile to misaligned incentives, adversarial exploitation, coordination failure.                           |
| Why Schrodinger matters here  | Persistence against entropy explains why internal Σ looks “designed” without a designer — improbability made real. | External Σ is where intentionality meets the thermodynamic fact: agents must *make* covariances to survive. |
